                The JMARS XR Platform is a group of software developed by Meteor Studio utilized for viewing GIS planetary data in augmented and virtual reality. The JMARS XR Capstone team was tasked with developing new features and building out new experiences for the JMARS XR Platform. During our capstone, our team rebuilt the JMARS AR smartphone application, implemented new data-rich features into JMARS VR, and developed a new experience for exploring GIS data in Dreamscape Learn.
            </p>

            <p class="project_text">
                During our first sprints, our team rebuilt the JMARS AR smartphone application from the ground up. We have brought it to a newer version of the Unity Game Engine, allowing the application to be utilized with newer versions of iOS and Android Devices. Our team also built the application to take advantage of the new JMARS API, which allows the user to view multiple terrain image layers at once.

            </div>


            <p class="project_text">
                Our team also worked on developing new features and functionality within the JMARS VR application. We have implemented per-pixel data reading for both multiplayer and single-player experiences and have added pixel-accurate nomenclature (landmark) pins. Our team has also worked with Meteor Studio to completely rebuild the user interface within the application to improve ease of use and data interactions.

            </div>



            <p class="project_text">
                Lastly, our team worked on developing a new application to add to the JMARS XR suite of software: JMARS Dreamscape. JMARS Dreamscape utilizes room-scale VR environments and Joystick controls to allow up to four non-experienced users the ability to explore GIS planetary data. Utilizing ThrustMaster joysticks, users are able to fly around the terrain on their own individual platform. Users are also able to modify the image layers and height data associated with the terrain, similar to the functionality within JMARS VR.

            <p class="project_text">
                Due to scheduling constraints, our team was unable to test our application within the Dreamscape Pods at ASU. However, we have worked closely with Meteor Studio to ensure that our team would be able to deliver a minimum viable product that can be easily ported into the Dreamscape SDK and be ready to play with minimal effort. Moving forward, future development on this product will be done within the Dreamscape Pods and build out any missing functionality.
