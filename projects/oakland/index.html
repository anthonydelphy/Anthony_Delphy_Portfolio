                During the December of 2022, Meteor Studio was approached by the Oakland A's athletic team to create scoreboard visuals for their 2023 spring training at Hohokam Stadium in Mesa, Arizona. I was chosen as the project lead and worked with several other students to design the visuals. Our team spent roughly a month and a half to create the visuals, which included stingers (visuals that react to plays during a baseball game), landscape visuals that will loop throughout the game, and vector illustrations that represent Mesa and Hohokam Stadium.

                The team would regularly meet with our stakeholders to iterate upon our designs and alter them to their liking. After mutliple iterations, our designs were revealed at the opening game of the season and our team was congraluated for our work on the field. Our team was later interviewed live on Fox 10 News for our work.
